# Eye fundus image quality assessment and enhancement
This repository contains information related to research both for eye fundus image quality assessment and enhancement.

## Quality Assesment

The quality assesment research is presented in our paper [A Lightweight Deep Learning Model for Mobile Eye Fundus Image Quality Assessment](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11330/113300K/A-lightweight-deep-learning-model-for-mobile-eye-fundus-image/10.1117/12.2547126.short?SSO=1).
